Adopted Dataset: 
==============================

You have adopted the dataset Agricultural Productivity in the U.S., from Department of Agriculture (USDA). 

This project contains the dataset entry from the Department of Agriculture (USDA) data.json file. 

Your mission if you choose to accept it, is to:

* Clean up data to the best of your knowledge and ability
* Create new distributions of the dataset in common formats like CSV and JSON
* Better describe and tag the dataset in the Data.json entry
* Create APIs from data and add as service link

The goal is to leave the dataset in tact, but improve on it and help the Department of Agriculture (USDA) better serve the public, by making their datasets more discoverable and usable.

Update your Data.json entry, and the [Federal Agency Dataset Adoption](http://federal-agency-dataset-adoption.publicprivatesector.org/index.html) crawler will find your repository and spider your data.json entry for updates. It will use the data.json file and any changes as updates for any work you do.

If you have any questions visit the [Federal Agency Dataset Adoption Github issue page](https://github.com/kinlane/federal-agency-dataset-adoption/issues).
