Adopted Federal Agency Dataset: 
==============================

This is a repository dedicated to adopting federal agencies datasets, cleaning up, generating machine readable formats, and much more.

Each branch in this repository represents a dataset I've adopted. It is up to me to make the dataset better than it is, and the Federal Agency Dataset Adoption will use Github to link my work back to federal agencies data.json files.

Use the repository branch manager to navigate each separate dataset. If you are visiting this repository, and would like to adop a federal agency dataset, visit  [Federal Agency Dataset Adoption](http://federal-agency-dataset-adoption.publicprivatesector.org/index.html).

If you have any questions visit the [Federal Agency Dataset Adoption Github issue page](https://github.com/kinlane/federal-agency-dataset-adoption/issues).
