Adopted Dataset: 
==============================

You have adopted the dataset [title], from [agency name]. 

This project has two main things:

* Adoption Entry - A JSON file that registers you with the mother ship.
* Data.json Entry - The entry for this dataset in the agency's data.json file
 
Now that you have adopted this dataset, you should:

* Clean up data to the best of your knowledge and ability
* Create new distributions of it in common formats like CSV and JSON
* Better describe and tag the dataset in the Data.json entry

The goal is to leave the dataset in tact, but improve on it and help the [agency name] better serve the public, by making their datasets more discoverable and usable.

Update your Data.json entry, and the Federal Agency Dataset Adoption crawler will use the adoption entry (adoption-entry.json) file to find your repository and spider your data.json entry for updates. It will use the data.json file and any changes as updates for any work you do.

You can now rename this repository to any name that is meaningful to you, and thank you for your work!
